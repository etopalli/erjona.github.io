        		<h1>Blog post zero</h1>
			<p> Here it is folks, ground zero for lo and behold, my blog. I hope this conveys to you reading this alphabet soup of words that I am starting this venture with trepidation as well as surprise that I got to this point. She made it folks. She wrote a few sentences, meta though they feel, about a first blog post. Now introductions are due, so this blog post won’t be as painful. That’s the norm at least for most human interactions, but who can say for sure. I have forgotten most of my small-talk manners this past year; at least that’s my excuse. Between you and me, I don’t think I was ever that gifted in that department anyways. And what’s more small-talk than a first blog post. 
I’m sure by now you’re asking yourself, is she supposed to be a clown by profession? Is this a comedic post she wrote or is she pretending to be deep in some sort of quirky, “i’m just not like other girls” kinda way? First off, that is presumptuous of you, but yes I am a woman so you got that one correct. I also am many other things --aren’t we all-- a list of which you can read, or gather, if you head on over to my resume. And before I go off the deep end (again), I will get to the point of me writing this blog post zero and you reading (well, I’ll write about my own purpose, you can make up your own, good sport.)
I have wanted a way to engage with people in a broad sense for a long time, but it’s always felt like a titanic feat and I have felt too overwhelmed and anxious to really put myself out there. I mean, you saw the vortex I threw at your face just trying to get to this sentence? Since most social media feels narrow, or unable to give me such broad access as a blog would, I have come to the conclusion that yes, I would benefit from interacting with the world in this way. It will also be a way of me “cleaning house” where by house I mean my brain, where by brain I mean my thought processes. I could definitely use that as well. If you enjoy my ramblings, for some weird and bizarre reason (jk, you’re a wondrous person, you special weirdo), please follow along. I do not have a mail notification system set up, but who knows, maybe I will eventually get to it, and you can bookmark me or something (I dunno, you can make your own decisions, I’m not your mom...)
So long, and see you around.
