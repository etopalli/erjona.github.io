        		<h1>Blog post zero</h1>
			<p>Here it is folks, ground zero for lo and behold, my blog. I hope this conveys to you reading this alphabet soup of words that I am starting this venture with trepidation as well as surprise that I got to this point. She made it folks. She wrote a few sentences, meta though they feel, about a first blog post. Introductions are due, but this blog post shouldn’t be reduced to the painful anxious mess the human behind it usually is when it comes to introductions. The norm for most first interactions is to start with an introduction, but I don’t know that I have the strength to summarize who I am for a quick introduction to a general audience in a medium that will stay indestructible til the end of time (well, more or less). So, maybe, the focus of this first virtual interaction of ours can be something else entirely. Not the who but the why.
				I’m sure by now you’re asking yourself, is she some sort of a <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jester”> joker-slash-clown by profession </a>? Is this a tryout comedic post you’ll ask or is this writer pretending to be deep in some sort of quirky “i’m not like other girls” kinda way? First off, that is presumptuous of you, but yes I am a woman so you got that partially correct. I also am many other things --aren’t we all-- a sample list of which you can read, or gather, if you head on over to my resume. See, I give you responsibility and power (to make assumptions about me). And before I go off the deep end (again), I will get to the point of me writing this blog post zero and your reading it (well, at least about my own purpose, you’re on your own to figure yours out, old sport.)
				I have been wanting a way to engage with people in a broad sense for a long time. It’s always felt like a titanic feat and I have felt too overwhelmed and anxious to really put myself out there. Exhibit A, the vortex I whirled at you just trying to get to this sentence. Since most social media feels limited in scope, or unable to give me such broad access, I have come to the conclusion that yes, I would benefit from interacting with the world in this way through a blog. It will also be a way for me to “clean house”. Where by house I mean my brain. I could definitely use that as well. If you enjoy my ramblings, for some weird and bizarre reason (just kidding, you’re a special cookie, you weirdo), please follow along. I do not have a e-mail notification system set up, but who knows, maybe I will eventually get to it, for now you can bookmark me or something of the sort (how would I know, you can make your own decisions, I am not your mother.)

			So long, and see you around digital friends.
